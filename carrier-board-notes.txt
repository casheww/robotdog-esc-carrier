power tab
    - tab width = 18.796
    - spacing = 4.064
    - depth = 1.6
    
programming
    - header on side of each ESC
    - 5 pins
    


current draw:
per module: 
    - 12V, 30mA
    - 5V (to get 12V), 150mA
    - 5V for microcontroller, 100mA
    - total: 5V, 250mA

all 3 modules:
    - 12V, 90mA
    - 5V, 750mA

between ESC power and control boards = 6mm
between consecutive ESC sets = 18mm ???
